Connect your wallet to our platform by clicking "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner.

## Identity Verification

Due to regulatory requirements, all investors must complete our KYC/AML process:

1. Provide government-issued ID
2. Proof of address
3. Complete a brief questionnaire

This verification process helps us maintain a secure and compliant platform for all users.
